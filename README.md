<h2>Story</h2>

<h3>
  My name is Aboubacar Barry, a young self-taught full-stack developer from Mali, now specializing in frontend development. React JS is what I use most in my daily work. It has allowed me to start and understand the JavaScript ecosystem and the web in general.

  My journey in programming wasn't easy, especially for a self-taught developer. Adding to the challenge, I come from Africa and a background where people primarily use computers for watching movies, YouTube, and office work.

  Despite all this, I overcame the challenge, creating local solutions that helped me earn some income for my daily expenses and equipment. I don't work for a company; I'm a free electron developing local solutions for now, learning development deeply, and coding open-source projects.
</h3>

This versatile code will allow me to launch a project quickly based on its type
without spending time reconfiguring everything or figuring out where to start.

Covers most cases in the development of an application like.

- **Frontend**
  - HTML / CSS                  => Classic web page
  - Framework                   => For modern applications
  - UI LIB / Animations LIB     => Enhance the user experience

- **Backend**
  - Script                      => Programming language used
  - Framework                   => Facilitate API and server development
  - Database                    => Make the application persistent
  - OS                          => Operating system on which the platform runs
  - CLOUD                       => Deployment and CI/CD

## Example of tech stack (Postgresql, Express JS, React JS, Node JS)
