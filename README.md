# ABOU-STACK ðŸš€

This versatile code will allow me to launch a project quickly based on its type
without spending time reconfiguring everything or figuring out where to start.

Covers most cases in the development of an application.

## Motivation

I build this tech stack, to create my application fast and focus in code.
Javascript is fast and all days your are some framework !

- **Frontend**
  - HTML / CSS                  => Classic
  - Framework                   => For modern applications
  - UI / Animations LIB         => Enhance the user experience

- **Backend**
  - Script                      => Programming language used
  - Framework                   => Facilitate API and server development
  - Database                    => Make the application persistent
  - OS                          => Operating system on which the platform runs
  - CLOUD                       => Deployment and CI/CD

## Tools Used in My Stack

- Vite for the client
- Node / Express for the backend environment
- PostgreSQL for the database
- Git for versioning the code
- Eslint and Prettier to improve development comfort
- CI: NODE JS to quickly scaffold a derivative of the project
