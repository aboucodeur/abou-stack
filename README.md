# ABOU-STACK ðŸš€

This versatile code will allow me to launch a project quickly based on its type
without spending time reconfiguring everything or figuring out where to start.

Covers most cases in the development of an application like.

- **Frontend**
  - HTML / CSS                  => Classic web page
  - Framework                   => For modern applications
  - UI / Animations LIB         => Enhance the user experience

- **Backend**
  - Script                      => Programming language used
  - Framework                   => Facilitate API and server development
  - Database                    => Make the application persistent
  - OS                          => Operating system on which the platform runs
  - CLOUD                       => Deployment and CI/CD

## Motivation

My motivation is understand tooling not focus them.
I build this starter to fastly build app based to 80%
of my tech stack like PERN, MERN, LAMP, ASTRO ....

## MAIN TECH STACK IS (Postgresql, Express JS, React JS, Node JS)
